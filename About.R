#A couple of weeks ago, I looked at the consumer complaints dataset and analyzed
#the data. After going over that data, I decided that for this final project I
#wanted to focus on consumer complaint submission mediums (the way in which the
#consumers submitted their complaints) as well as the timeliness of the company
#responses. I built two tables and two charts, and each one represents this information
#in a different way.

#The first table shows all of the ways in which complaints were submitted, which
#includes email, fax, phone, postal mail, referral, and the web. I paired this
#information with the timeliness of responses from the companies. Yes means that
#the response was timely, and No means it was too slow. I wanted to see if the
#medium through which customers submitted complaints had any impact on the
#speed at which their issue was handled. Proportionally, phone calls seem to result
#in the least satisfying response time.

#For my second table, I looked at the response time in conjunction with the company
#response to the consumer. I wanted to see if the company response to the consumer
#complaint had any bearing on whether the response time was satisfactory or not.

#For my visualizations, I made two charts that display one variable. The first
#shows submission mediums, and the second shows the responsiveness to complaints.
#I wanted to make this information easier to visualize and not cluttered. For example,
#the second chart makes it rather clear that response times were overwhelmingly
#good. The first shows that most submissions, by far, were made through the web.
